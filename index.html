        <img src="img/diana.jpg"> 
    <p> some random and fun facts i can add here. i'm Guatemalan, both of my parents are from Guatemalan.</p>
    <p> i have lived in the East Bay my whole life and I'm grateful for that because of the people i have met here.</p>
    <p>my favorite color is purple, been standing strong on that since I was 14 so I hope not to change my mind anytime
     soon because it is the color of my room LOL. </p>
     <p>its kind of funny because sfsu was my first choice because i'm looking forward to wearing purple gowns when i graduate</p>
    <p> my favorite artists are Taylor Swift and Frank Ocean. i was able to go to the Eras Tour concert when she came to
    the Levi's stadium in Santa Clara. it was a great brithday gift. that was my first concert ever, it was nice to finally see her because i've liked her since i was a kid.
    i'm looking to go to more concerts but nobody so far has caught my attention. but I did was to go to Laufey's concert but
     her tickets were sold out so fast. </p>
    <p>my brithday is june 21st. i do love summer, i think the heat is better than cold weather but thats just me.</p>
